    Communitech helps tech companies start, grow and succeed. That’s our mission, our mantra, our reason for being.
    Everything we do ties back to collaboration and helping—values that run deep in our organization.
  </p>
  <p>
    Communitech was founded in 1997 by a group of entrepreneurs committed to making Waterloo Region a global
    innovation leader. At the time it was crazy talk, but somehow this community managed to pull it off. Today,
    Communitech is a public-private innovation hub that supports a community of more than 1,400 companies — from
    startups to scale-ups to large global players.<br><br>

    Communitech helps tech companies start, grow and succeed in three distinct ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
     <li>Communitech is a place – the centre of gravity for entrepreneurs and innovators. A clubhouse for building cool shit and great companies.</li>
     <li>Communitech delivers programs – helping companies at all stages with access to capital, customers and talent. We are here to help them grow and innovate.</li>
     <li>Communitech partners in building a world-leading ecosystem – making sure we have all the ingredients (and the brand) to go from a small startup to a global giant.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Our team is dedicated and passionate. Regardless of role, we work together every day to help our tech companies
    overcome barriers to success. Team members can often be found throughout the community at all kinds of events.
    Next time you see one of us, say hi.

    DeltaHacks is the annual hackathon for change, it's even in the name! The primary focus of DeltaHacks is to
    enable hackers from all over to make a change, whether it be in education, finance, health or any other field,
    we're extremely passionate about hacking to make a positive change! We work with McMaster University to welcome
    hackers of all levels, from the novice to the most experienced! We supply the food, venue, and workshops to
    provide even the most seasoned veterans with new experiences. Now in our 6th year running, DeltaHacks VI is our
    biggest and best DeltaHacks yet. Join us this January and take part in an experience you won’t forget!
  </p>

  <b>What is a hackathon?</b>
  <p>
    A hackathon is just a fancy word for a technical competition! We provide our attendees the opportunity to work
    with new people on cool ideas, and the resources necessary to make those ideas come to life. We do not condone
    nor do we allow any actual hacking or other illegal activities!
  </p>

  <b>What is DeltaHacks?</b>
  <p>
    DeltaHacks is McMaster's annual student hackathon. This year, DeltaHacks will be a 700-participant event taking
    place late January. We hope to inspire students to hack for positive changes that align with their passions -
    whether it's environment, health, inequality, education, etc. And hence the name “delta” - as “Δ” stands for
    change.
